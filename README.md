Test suite for PDF/A-2 conformance
----------------------------------

The files here are licensed under the [Creative Commons Public License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode).

Included are a collection of PDF documents that should either pass or fail
a conformance test against the specified profile (PDF/A-1b or PDF/A-2b).
The description.txt file lists the reason they should pass or fail.

This collection was inspired by the [Isartor test suite](http://www.pdfa.org/2011/08/isartor-test-suite/)
and follows a similar layout with respect to test case names, including the
section of the PDF/A specification to which each test refers.

Please contact [BFO Support](mailto:support@bfo.com) if you wish to
collaborate on this project and add new test cases.
